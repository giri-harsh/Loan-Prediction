# Loan Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project predicts loan approval status based on applicant details using **Logistic Regression**.  
It includes **data preprocessing, encoding, scaling, and model training**.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing (handling categorical & numerical data)
- One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- Logistic Regression model for prediction
- Accuracy evaluation of the model
